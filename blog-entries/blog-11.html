        <h1>Week 11 (12/10/21): Teaching Web Dev (& Closing Remarks)</h1>
    </div>


    <p>For my final blog of the semester, I've been asked "How would you teach web development class if you were
        the professor?" (Or something along those lines.)
    </p>

    <h2>How would you design the course, my good sir?</h3>

        <p> I enjoyed the content very much in the class this semester. I honestly thought all the content was
            fairly relevant. If there were any cuts I would make to the class, I would say shorten the intro
            to HTML & CSS. I do feel like these are quite essential to the course, but I feel like students
            can pick up on it relatively quick. Also, probably if not all students, the vast majority of
            students have some previous experience with it. I would say focus I little more on creating web 
            services and web frameworks. Maybe even include a short introduction to another framework besides
            React, like Vue or Angular.

        </p>

    <h2>In the professor's shoes, what would you have your students do?</h3>

        <p>I'm personally a huge fan of lectures, but I feel like a hand on experience is valuable to 
            keeping the students engaded and learning. If the class was set on a two day a week schedule,
            I would prefer to have a lecture the first day of the week and then apply that newly gained
            knowledge to a lab. Another idea I had would be to split each class in half. To keep the
            information fresh for students, the earlier half could be a lecture and then the latter half
            have the students do an exercise. Although, labs would be a lot shorter in this case, and
            only a single task would sufice - versus two or three.
        </p>

    <h2>Based on experience, what helped you learn the material in Web Dev (CS347) and any advice
        to provide to future students?</h3>

        <p>I would say what I found most useful about the material were the demos provided in Prof. Chris
            Johnson's online textbook, <a href="https://allover.twodee.org/">All Over the Web</a>. It
            was honestly really nice to see an example of how you would put together a web service and
            an approach of how you can set it up. Most of the time, I would follow along the demo's for
            practice and make a similar service with a few additions/modifications. I would recommend
            others to do the same
        </p>
        <p>
            Most students might not appreciate this next point as much - because it's a weekly activity
            they might dread - but in my option, putting together this very blog and learning something
            new each week enforces a very important concept to web dev and CS as a whole. With advancing
            software & technology, new things are always being discovered and built. It's important to be
            savy in arising tech and explore. Don't be so reliant on professors/teachers spoon feeding
            information to you.

    <p>Thanks for sticking along my journey of maintaining a weekly scheduled blog! Hope you were able to
        pick up on a couple things here and there from these weekly blogs or were at least entertained. 
        Well, this marks the end of the road.
