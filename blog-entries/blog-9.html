        <h1>Week 9 (11/17/21): Dark Mode</h1>
    </div>

    <p>Today, we'll discuss the popular and trendy dark mode theme for webpages.
    </p>

    <h2>Can you Give me a Remark on the Mode of the Dark?</h3>

    <p>It might be obvious but in case you don't know, dark mode or dark theme is a mode for
        viewing content in a mostly dark atmosphere on the UI. Dark mode reduces the amount of
        light emitted by your viewing screen, while at the same time including
        enough contrast for content to be viewed well.
    </p>
    
    <p>Generally, dark mode may include a dark
        background color, like a dark grey, with bright text layered on top. On the opposite
        end of the spectrum, light mode includes a white background color, with black or dark
        colored text.
    </p>

    <h2>What are the perks and losses of Dark Mode?</h3>

    <p>Pros:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Saves energy/power - especially for devices with OLED and AMOLED displays</li>
        <li>Tends to reduce eye strain in low light conditions</li>
        <li>A darker screen reduces glare, furthermore, minimizing blue and flickering light</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Cons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In some situations, it can inhibit eye strain instead of reducing it - such as in blight
            conditions where text is difficult to read</li>
        <li>Light Mode generally has better readability - especially for longer strings of text</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How can I Enable a Webpage to be in Dark Mode?</h2>

    <p>Ocassionally you can see a toggle for light and dark mode with a button on a well built webpage. There
        may be an accessibility control button hidden in the corner, giving the option.
    </p>

    <p>Although, more often than not, dark mode can be choosen at the operating system level in system 
        settings/preferences. On many popular browsers, like Firefox and Chrome, they include a browser
        option to change to a dark theme. Furthermore, on some browsers you can toggle dark and light
        theme in the developer tools or inspector of a webpage when the webpage has an enabled dark and
        light theme.
    </p>

    <h2>Any Ideal Design Choices to Make When Including this Mode?</h2>

    <p>Implementing a dark mode may seem fairly simple, although it's a little more challenging
        to design one. Here are a couple points to pay attention to when designing a dark mode:
    </p>

    <h3>Add a Dark Filter for Images</h3>
    <p>Decreasing the brightness and contrast of images on a page is much better than jarring contrast of 
        bright images.
    </p>

    <h3>Find a balanced Style for the Typography</h3>
    <p>Similar to images, the contrast needs to be balanced. Find a midpoint between too heavy and bold of a
        font and too thin and condensed of a font that will strain someone's eyes.
    </p>

    <h3>Make Dark Mode Colors Softer</h3>
    <p>Pure white text ontop of a pure black can be jarring. An off-white can do the trick here and a dark
        gray, like #121212 as suggested by the <a href="https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html">
        Materal Design Dark Theme Guidelines</a>.</p>
