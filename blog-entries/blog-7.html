        <h1>Week 7 (11/5/21): Web Services</h1>
        <i>
            <p>NOTE: The topic I've choosen for this week is less about coding, more of a discussion to someone new
                to a web service. I wanted to cover this topic now, as it has been covered most recently.</p>
            <p>Enjoy the stock Creative Commons photos instead of code this week :)</p>

    <p>This week we've dive in and cover the world of web services.</p>

    <h2>Web Services - Are You Speaking a Foriegn Language?</h2>

    <p>Now, I’m sure you’ve at least heard of the name Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud
        Platform (GCP). These are all major web services.</p>

    <p>From a broad perspective, a web service is a software application providing protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) to
        communicate, share, and exchange data over a network. Most commonly web services are XML-data oriented. A
        positive of web services, is for the ability of applications to be written in different languages, but still
        have the ability to communicate and exchange information to other applications through servers and clients. A
        web service hides implementation details in which it can be used separately in hardware or software contexts
        through an <i>interface</i>.</p>

    <p>The following features make up a web service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Accessible over internet/intranet networks
        </li>
        <li>
            Includes a standardized XML messaging system
        </li>
        <li>
            Independent of a OS or programming language
        </li>
        <li>
            Self-describing via standard XML language
        </li>
        <li>
            Found through a simple location
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Are There any Varying Calibers of Web Services?</h2>

    <p>There are quite a few out there. I'll name several below:

    <p><b>XML-RPC (Remote Procedure Call)</b> - claimed as the most basic XML protocol to exchange data over a broad
        scale of devices on a network. XML-RPC uses HTTP to painlessly transfer data and communicate information from
        client to server.</p>

    <p>
        <b>UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration)</b> - is an XML standard for detailing, publishing,
        as well as discovering web services. Simply put, It’s an internet registry for businesses around the globe. This
        standard has the goal in mind to streamline digital transactions/commerce among company systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>SOAP</b> - is an XML protocol used to exchange data and documents over HTTP or SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer
        Protocol). SOAP allows for independent processes operating on differing systems to communicate through XML.
    </p>

    
    <img src="../images/web-developer.jpg" alt="Web developer fixing web service"
        style="float:right; width:33%; padding:2.5em">

    <p>
        <b>REST</b> - provides communication and connectivity between devices and the internet for API-like tasks.
        RESTful services typically will use HTTP as the supporting protocol.
    </p>

    <p>
        SOAP and REST are some of the most popular choices among developers. There’s been a lot of debate as to which
        one is the winner over all the competition, although, it seems to be the context for when it’s being used
        matters most of all. A REST web service is often great for when time is a factor, but SOAP seems to be best when
        building a service with many, non-CRUD methods. Oftentimes, companies will support both choices, including
        Amazon and eBay.
    </p>
        
    <h2>Could You Explain the Architecture of Web Services?</h2>

    <p>
        In order for the framework to function ideally there needs to be some architecture to support it. There are
        three distinct roles in the architecture of web services which all assist in finding, binding, and publishing
        the web service:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Service Provider</b>: creates the web service and makes it available to the client application to use it for its
            own specific purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Service Requestor</b>: known as the client application that is needed to contact the web service. Popular
            service requestors include .Net, Java which search for a particular kind of functionality through a web
            service.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Service Broker</b>: the application that gives access to the UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and
            Integration), providing a repository on which various XML notation files for describing the service
            (including WSDL) may be hosted.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
        Wait a Sec, I’ve Heard the Term “API” Thrown Around a Bit. Is an API and a Web Service the Same Thing?
    </h2>

    <p>
        Kinda, but not exactly. An API or application programming interface offers a service to other pieces of
        software, forming a connection between computers/programs. Most web services provide an API, which, with its set
        of commands and functions, is used to retrieve data. An example of this includes Twitter, which delivers an API
        authorizing a developer to access tweets from a server and then collects data in JSON format.
