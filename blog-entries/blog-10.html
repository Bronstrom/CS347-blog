        <h1>Week 10 (12/3/21): Web Frameworks</h1>
        <i>
            <p>NOTE: The topic I've choosen for this week is less about coding, more of a discussion to someone new
                to a web frameworks. I wanted to cover this topic now, as it has been covered most recently.</p>
            <p>Enjoy some web framework logo & stock Creative Commons photos instead of code this week :)</p>

    <p>Web frameworks are being used all across the web and around us everyday. In a way, they are the way of the
        future when it comes to developing web applications!
    </p>

    <h2>In What Way are We Framing the Web?</h3>

        <p> In a basic sense, frameworks are code libraries, that tend to be open source. They can help achieve
            structure and give additional features that may take a ton of work to put together from scratch. They can
            nicely provide a place to start with an ideal set of configurations for a project. When we speak in terms of
            web frameworks -
            they can be in relation to frontend, backend, or even interface frameworks.
        </p>

        <h2>What's the Point of Using a Framework?</h2>

        <p>
            Let's put it this way: you don't have to build an application on a web framework, although, it will likely
            be a lot more tedious and there will be a lot of duplication in terms of features. Without the use of a
            framework to build
            an application, you will be writing duplicate logic a lot of the
            time. Frameworks give a lot of tools to developers, which can enhance and speed up the efficiency of an
            application. With frameworks, there is often a trade off between abstraction of framework code and a
            limitation of some flexibility versus the amount of complexity of code. Although,
            some frameworks may have a bit of a learning curve, in the long run they will can be huge time savers.
        </p>

        <h2>Can You Elaborate on the Types of Frameworks?</h2>

        As mentioned above, there are three main types of web frameworks: <b>frontend</b>, <b>backend</b>, and
        <b>interface</b> frameworks.
        In terms of web applications, the <b>frontend</b> consists of the interactive parts of the page, as the
        <b>backend</b> consists of the server
        and database as well as the code interacting with both, while the <b>interface</b> is the stylized and parts
        polishing the page. I'll mention
        a few popular frameworks for each category of a web application and there benefits (& cons):


        <h3>Frontend Frameworks</h3>

            <li><i>Front-end incorporation can be difficult</i></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When Choosing Frameworks What Should come into Consideration?</h2>

        <p>
            Choosing frameworks for a project, is a vital step to the development life cycle. Often
            times when a working with a development team (especially when under tight time constraints), learning curve
            of a framework, integration of
            libraries, familiarity of languages, and desired features should come into mind. Often time,
            the popularity of frameworks should be considered to either meet or go beyond client and industry
            standards.
        </p>

        <h2>With So Many Frameworks for Parts of An Application, Are There Ideal/Common Pairings?</h2>

        <p>
            While your goals should be assessed first when choosing frameworks, standards are also a huge
            consideration. In terms of more ideal pairings between front-end, back-end, & interface frameworks, there
            are
            some more compatible and practical pairings. I'll mention a couple below with their benifits:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>ReactJS and Express/Node.js</b> - Both based on JavaScript languages and ease of running React code
                on NodeJS environment
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Angular and Express/Node.js</b> - Both support Typescript and Node package manager provides "ng CLI"
                (the Angular command-line interface)
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Angular and Spring Boot</b> - Spring boot supports Angular's two-way (bidirectional) binding and both
                combined
                provide a secure user experience
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>React Native and Django</b> - Runs fast, secure & requires less code compared to other frameworks
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Vue and Lararvel</b> - Coupled well with each other and Laravel implements Vue in an easy way a
                scaffolding (basic skeleton design) UI
            </li>
        </ul>
