        <h1>Week 1 (9/3/21): Web Hosting</h1>
        <i>
            <p>NOTE: The topic I've choosen for this week is less about coding, more of a discussion to someone new
                to hosting. I wanted to cover this topic, and starting with it earlier than later seemed like a good
                idea in my mind.</p>

    <p>With it being the first week of my blog and fairly early in the set-up process of it,
        the topic of web hosting seemed quite relevant.</p>

    <h2>What in the World is Web Hosting?</h2>
    <p>Web hosting is a service which enables for files, including code and images, composing a
        website to be accessible to users across the internet. Web server(s) store all files of a website
        and are managed by a hosting provider.</p>

    <h2>How do I get Started with Web Hosting?</h2>
    <p>Web hosting is an essential step of the web development process . . . if you plan on sharing your
        website with the world. The first step is to register a domain name for the website, which will be
        permant address where users can find your site. Secondly, you will need to choose a hosting provider
        and plan. (Occassionally domain names will come in package deals with a hosting plan.)

    <p>In a world like today, free web hosting can be difficult to find, although there
        are several cheaper options that seem to be pretty good.</p>

    <h2>What are Some Web Hosting Services?</h2>
    <p>There are many! I will discuss the more major types of web hosting services:</p>

    <h3><a id="shared">Shared Web Hosting</a></h3>

    <p>Often known as the cheapest and "entry-level" hosting service, <b>shared web hosting</b> provides
        consumers a shared physical server with the same resources, including CPU, RAM, and disk space.
        As a result of many users using the same resources, a low traffic and bandwidth website is most
        desirable on a shared web hosting platform. Minimal technical experience is required in using
        this hosting service.</p>

    <p>A fairly cheap and decent shared web hosting service, I've used in past years is
        <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/">Blue Host</a>. Definitely would recommend if your looking for a
        more budget-friendly and bang for your buck hosting service.
    </p>

    <h3><a id="dedicated_server">Dedicated Server Hosting</a></h3>

    <p><b>Dedicated server hosting</b> is where you are renting a physical server from a hosting company.
        A dedicated server is considered to be the highest level of server needed for a buisness with high
        traffic and is typically one of the more expensive options. Often times hiring a system administrator
        is hired to work out the technical details for a dedicated server.</p>

        style="float:right; width:33%; padding:2.5em">

    <h3><a id="vps">Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting</a></h3>

    <p><b>Virtual private servers</b> share a single physical server, but in a way act like multiple by dividing
        it into smaller virtual servers. VPS hosting is in between <b>shared hosting</b> and <b>dedicated machine
            hosting</b>.</p>

    <h3><a id="cloud">Cloud Hosting</a></h3>

    <p><b>Cloud hosting</b> is one of the biggest growing forms of hosting today. In fact, this blog was
        configured with a cloud hosting service, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>. While
        <b>dedicated server</b> hosting provides a single server for hosting, <b>cloud hosting</b> spreads out data
        accross multiple machines. One of the main advantages of <b>cloud hosting</b> is it's "elastic scaling",
        allowing for more CPU cores, RAM, and other recources to fit web traffic.
    </p>

    <h2>Do I Need a Web Hosting Service to Show Off My Website?</h2>

    <p>You totally can host a website yourself and purely from your own home basement if you wanted!
        Although, there are a number of limitations when going this route, it's more technical, and can be
        quite pricey.</p>

    <p>To completely host a website yourself, you would need to have an (expensive) server with
        a constantly-running power supply and high bandwidth internet. You would also need to ensure your Internet
        Service Provider (ISP) would allow for you to run a website like this &mdash; not all do. Furthermore, it would
        require a high technical knowledge for setting-up and maintaining it, including knowledge on setting up
        "WWW" server software.</p>
